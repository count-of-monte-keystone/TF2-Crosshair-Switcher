# TF2-Crosshair-Switcher

## Notice: This project is no longer maintained. A better version of this project exists [here](https://github.com/count-of-monte-keystone/laz-vtf-tf2-crosshair-selector-REDUX).

A simple program for automating crosshair changing for weapons in Team Fortress 2.

All weapon scripts are hard-coded in so any missing ones may cause issues.

There are specific filepaths where the weapon scripts and VTF crosshair files must be in order for this program to work.

Here are some helpful links if you're confused (HUGE credit to joshuawan and laz):
